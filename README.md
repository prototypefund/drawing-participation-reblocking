# Drawing Participation: Reblocking
## A generative AI and collaboration tool for the common good, addressing urban migration
### Reference Repo for the Drawing Participation - Reblocking Repositories

### About the Project
Drawing Participation: Reblocking allows global mapping and characterization of informal settlements and provides a scalable tool to develop cadastral maps for these communities as they plan for future growth and urbanisation.

It addresses the current scarcity of municipal planning data and seeks to empower literacy and collaboration in the vernacular building process. This builds a foundation for land-tenure, municipal recognition, and essential infrastructure planning, such as energy, freshwater, and sanitation.

The approach automates a wide range of tasks, scaling and supporting on-site work currently manually performed on-site by surveyors and NGOs.

### 
The project was made possible by the Prototype Fund and was funded through the Federal Ministry of Education and Research from March 2024 until August 2024. Read more on the Prototype Fund's [Demo Week 15 Website](https://prototypefund.de/project/million-neighborhoods-re-blocking/) (in German).

If you are interested in supporting or joining the project or simply want to find out more, please reach out via <mail(at)drawing-participation.org>. We're looking forward to hearing from you!
